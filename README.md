# osu-player-rank
Scrape for your current standings in osu! See just how far being a dirty farmer gets you!

## Running
Need Python 3.7.x
Runs with:  
```bash
python osuplayers.py <PLAYER ID>  
```
where \<PLAYER ID\> is your actual player id number, NOT your username.  
I don't think osu! has an API, so I can't be bothered to scrape username lookups yet.
Check the url on your profile on osu.ppy.sh if you can't find your id.
